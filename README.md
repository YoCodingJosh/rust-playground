# rust-playground

Teaching myself Rust, but the kinda hard way.

My learning is organized into chapters, so one can kinda follow the way I'm learning.

Chapters:

* Chapter 0 - Humble Beginnings
* Chapter 1 - There's no ifs, whiles, fors, or butts about it.
* Chapter 2 - OOPs, I spilled my code all over! (Work in Progress!)
